# Importance of Log capturing #

Log capturing is very important when we run tests. It helps us to understand how the system behaves. More so in case of test failures, where we need to log certain files to understand why.

### Logging capabilities of Avocado ###

The logging capabilities of avocado are quite extensive.
* files - mainly sysfs files, and certain other files useful, captured before and after the test
* commands - command output run before and after the test
* profilers - runs these commands in background during the test

All of the above are captured into results folder. They are defined in avocado.conf, and can be customised.
